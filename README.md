# Module 4 Challenge pandas-challenge-1
## Background
This module challenge focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library.

In this challenge, we took digested business data including sales, number of units, costs and taxes.

## Exploration and Analysis
I dissected the data in multiple ways.

Found category with most entries.
For the category with the most entries, found subcategory with most entries.
Correctly identify the 5 clients with the most entries in the data
Data Transformation

## Summary
Able to identify the top 5 clients and produce data that shows where the focus of the company should be placed. Client 24741 ordered a total of 239862 units which created $36.58M in profit. The combination of the next 4 clients did not meet 50% of that margin. Company efforts should be made to increase clients 2-4, and large investments should be made into Client 24741 to ensure their business is maintained.
